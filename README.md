## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

* Some CSS properties like line-spacing for text and blockquote tag importance for semantic.
* Animations using opacity for better performance.

### Continued development

* Try another approach to show a divider and styling.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me dealing with background image styling and glowing effect for the button.
- [CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/simple-and-nice-blockquote-styling/) - Quote styling.
